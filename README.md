## 1.1 Patch Notes
- Optimised the window size to be more compact on Windows Devices.
- Fixed the error where Windows version failed to do line breaks.
- Optimised the Installer to offer Python 13.5 installation option. Versions older than Python 12 may have effect on the UI.


## Coming Soon!
- **Proper app versions with Swift for Mac, and C# for Windows**: The project's current Python base code can ensure reliable use, limiting the possibility of doing so with languages like Swift.
- **Remote Typing**: This is being developed to counter Codetantra SEA. Paste the code from one device onto a GitHub readme file, and it automatically starts typing on your (or multiple) devices.
- **Pocket Edition**: Sideload the pocket version of Codetantra + AutoTyperZer0 to complete your assignments on your phone (Concept planned).


## Known Bugs
- macOS Version opens with two icons in Dock, this will be fixed once the app is switched to swift.
- Collapsible text fields don't minimize on click unless another is opened, this will be fixed in coming updates.
