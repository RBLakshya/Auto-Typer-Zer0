## Coming Soon!

- **Pocket Edition**: Sideload the pocket version of Codetantra + AutoTyperZer0 to complete your assignments on your phone (Concept planned).


## Known Bugs
- macOS Version opens with two icons in Dock, this will be fixed once the app is switched to swift.
- Collapsible text fields don't minimize on click unless another is opened, this will be fixed in coming updates.
